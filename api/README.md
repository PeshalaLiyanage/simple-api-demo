# simple-api-demo
This repository is created to demonstrate a simple API

# Run the app
- Run `npm i`
- Run `npm start`

# Create a Express js app from scratch

- Run `node init -y`
- Run `npm i express`
- Run `npm i nodemon` 

# .env file

Create a .env file in the root of your project directory to store sensitive information like database credentials:

```DB_NAME=your_database_name
DB_USER=your_database_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
DB_HOST=localhost
```

This file should be added to the `.gitignore` file, as the credentials should not be added to the source code
